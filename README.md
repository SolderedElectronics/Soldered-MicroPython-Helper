# Soldered MicroPython Helper

‚ö†Ô∏è **Experimental Extension**  
Use at your own risk. This extension is actively being developed.

[VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SolderedElectronics.soldered-micropython-helper&ssr=false)

A MicroPython-focused helper for working with ESP-based boards directly inside Visual Studio Code.  
Flash firmware, upload scripts, monitor serial output, and fetch Soldered libraries ‚Äî all in one place.

---

## üöÄ Quick Setup (Required for Extension to Work)

Run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Install required Python tools
pip install esptool mpremote
```

Make sure:
- Your Python executables (`esptool` and `mpremote`) are in your system `PATH`
- You have permission to access serial ports (see below)

## üîç How to Find and Install in VS Code

1. Open **Visual Studio Code**
2. Go to the **Extensions** tab (or press `Ctrl+Shift+X`)
3. Search for: `Soldered MicroPython Helper`
4. Click **Install**

Or [install it directly from the VS Code Marketplace ‚Üí](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SolderedElectronics.soldered-micropython-helper&ssr=false)

## üîß Features

- Flash firmware to boards (via `esptool.py`)
- Upload and delete `.py` files (via `mpremote`)
- Live serial output monitoring
- Fetch libraries and examples from Soldered's GitHub
- Auto-detect serial ports and show device files

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Avoid Infinite Loops Without Delay

When writing MicroPython code ‚Äî especially when using `while True` loops ‚Äî it's **critical to include a `sleep()` or other delay inside the loop**. This is standard practice to avoid common issues such as:

- **CPU overload** ‚Äî the loop runs thousands of times per second without pause
- **Unreadable output** ‚Äî serial prints become too fast to read
- **Poor device responsiveness** ‚Äî the device may become unresponsive or glitchy
- **Unnecessary power consumption**

### ‚úÖ Recommended pattern:

```python
from time import sleep

while True:
    sleep(0.5)  # Add delay between iterations
    print("Doing something...")
```

Here's a real-world example from APDS9960 gesture detection:

```python
while True:
    sleep(0.5)
    if apds.isGestureAvailable():
        motion = apds.readGesture()
        print("Gesture={}".format(dirs.get(motion, "unknown")))
```

üß† **Tip**: You can adjust the delay based on sensor type or application needs ‚Äî just make sure *some* delay is present in every infinite loop.

---

## üõ† Other Notes

- On Linux/macOS, you may need to add your user to the `dialout` or `uucp` group:
  ```bash
  sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
  ```
  Then log out and back in.

- On Windows, try running VS Code as Administrator if ports don‚Äôt show up.

---

After completing the above, your VS Code extension should be able to access serial ports and run `esptool` and `mpremote` commands correctly.

## üß™ For Developers

If you'd like to contribute or modify this extension locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Install dependencies
Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), `npm`, and [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/) installed.

To use the `serialport` Node.js library, native build tools must be installed:

- **Windows:**
  ```bash
  npm install --global --production windows-build-tools
  ```

- **macOS:**
  ```bash
  xcode-select --install
  ```

- **Linux:**
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install build-essential python3-dev
  ```

Then, install `serialport`:

```bash
npm install serialport
```

Python packages (required globally or in your active environment):

```bash
npm install
pip install esptool mpremote
```

### 2. Build the extension
```bash
npm run vscode:prepublish
```

### 3. Launch in VS Code

- Open the project folder in VS Code.
- Press `F5` to open a new Extension Development Host window.
- The extension will load there and can be tested as if it were installed.
